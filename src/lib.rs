//
// rustdoc::invalid_codeblock_attributes we do NOT warn/deny/forbid here, even though it IS stable.
// That's because in `compile_fail` doctests we use error numbers, which are UNSTABLE only. But, to
// allow the same doctest also on stable toolchain, we ALLOW it here.
//
// See
// https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/unstable-features.html#error-numbers-for-compile-fail-doctests.
//
// But, as per that page, error numbers work on `nightly` only. On `stable` they make "code sample
// being interpreted as plain text"! So, we have those doctests in separate files, and we include
// them twice:
// - without the error code, and run as a part of standard doc generation, on `stable`. That makes
//   the doctest code formatted on `stable`.
// - with the error code, but on an element that has `#[cfg(doctest)]` attribute, so it's NOT a part
//   of doc generation, but it is still tested. That way it doesn't matter that `stable` would
//   format it as plain text, and it does get tested on `nightly` as a part of CI.
//
// Then on `nightly` we forbid rustdoc::invalid_codeblock_attributes. See
// .github/workflows/main.yml.
