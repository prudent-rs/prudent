//! To use the crate without lints:
//! 1. Invoke this macro at the top of your crate (`lib.rs`, or in your binary crates if they don't
//!    have `lib.rs`). Like this, **with** the leading double colon `::``
//!    ```ignore
//!    ::prudent::load!();
//!    ```
//!    But, from here on, never refer to `::prudent`. Instead,
//!    - use `prudent` in your `lib.rs` (or in the top level of your binary crates), and
//!    - use `crate::prudent` in your modules.
//! 2. Import (with alias(es) if there are any conflicts). This must be **without** any leading
//!    double colon `::`!
//!    ```ignore
//!    // At the top level of your `lib.rs` or a binary crate:
//!    use prudent::*;
//!    // elsewhere:
//!    use crate::prudent::*;
//!    ```
//! 3. Import in your submodules import (with alias(es if there are any conflicts):
//!    ```ignore
//!    use crate::prudent::*;
//!    ```
//!
//! If you need lints
//! - in doctests or custom integration tests (even if your crate is published on <crates.io>); or
//! - if your crate is not published on <crates.io>
//!
//! then pass the first parameter, a relative/absolute file path to your local clone/git submodule
//! copy/other copy of `src_linted/prudent_frontend_macros.rs`. So, instead of `#1` above, have
//! something like:
//! ```ignore
//!    ::prudent::load!("../../prudent/src/front_end.rs");
//! ```
//!
//! Pass a second parameter, after `->`, if you want the load in a module with name of your choice.

// rustdoc::missing_doc_code_examples we don't apply here, because it's nightly-only. Instead, we

//
// rustdoc::invalid_codeblock_attributes we do NOT warn/deny/forbid here, even though it IS stable.
// That's because in `compile_fail` doctests we use error numbers, which are UNSTABLE only. But, to
// allow the same doctest also on stable toolchain, we ALLOW it here.
//
// See
// https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/unstable-features.html#error-numbers-for-compile-fail-doctests.
//
// But, as per that page, error numbers work on `nightly` only. On `stable` they make "code sample
// being interpreted as plain text"! So, we have those doctests in separate files, and we include
// them twice:
// - without the error code, and run as a part of standard doc generation, on `stable`. That makes
//   the doctest code formatted on `stable`.
// - with the error code, but on an element that has `#[cfg(doctest)]` attribute, so it's NOT a part
//   of doc generation, but it is still tested. That way it doesn't matter that `stable` would
//   format it as plain text, and it does get tested on `nightly` as a part of CI.
//
// Then on `nightly` we forbid rustdoc::invalid_codeblock_attributes. See
