**Not** compilable.

See [prudent's README.md](../README.md) for expected compilation error codes. The error codes are
validated by [GitHub Actions](../.github/workflows/main.yml), see
[results](https://github.com/prudent-rs/prudent/actions). Error code validation requires `nightly`
Rust toolchain.

See also documentation in [prudent's src/lib.rs](../src/lib.rs).
